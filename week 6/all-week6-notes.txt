POJO/ Java Beans
	- POJO: Plain Old Java Object
		- Any java object, not bound to any specific restriction
		- used to define an entity
	- Java Beans
		- Special type of POJOs
			- All java beans are POJOs but not POJOs are Java beans
		- should implement the Serializable interface
			- marker interface that provides information to the compiler that a class can be serialized
				- serialization: process of converting an object into a stream of byte to store that object(file, db)...
		- no-args constructor defined
		- all fields to be encapsulated
			- private
			- setters/getters
		- override Object class methods
			- toString()
			- hashcode()
			- equals()

CRUD operations
	- Create | Read | Update | Delete
	- POST | GET | PUT | DELETE


Javalin
	- lightweight framework for Java (and Kotlin) to handle HTTP requests and response
	- runs on an embedded webserver(Jetty)
		- Jetty: an open source web server and servlet container which allows a servlet application to run 
	- Built on top of Servlets
	- Set up
		- dependencies
			- Javalin
			- slf4j
			- (Object mapper, optional)
		- main method
		- Javalin app = Javalin.create()
			      = Javalin.create( config -> {})
		- app.start(portNum)
			- by default 8080
		- HTTP handlers
			- a functional interface that takes in a Context Object as a parameter, used to specify a behavior to handle a request at a particular endpoint
				- Context object is an abstraction of HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse
					- used to retrieve information from the request
						- url
						- headers
						- body
					- used to add information to the response
						- headers
						- body
						- status code
				- https://javalin.io/documentation#context
			- app.get("path/endpoint", Executable<Handler>)
			- app.get("path/endpoint", lambda)
			- app.get("path/endpoint", (ctx) -> { // handle request})
			- app.post("path/endpoint"...)

			.../employees 
				- Get
					- retrieve all employees
				- Post
					- add a new employee
					- include employee information in the request body

JSON
	- JavaScript Object notation
		- JavaScript Like
		- string format used to represent objects to be exchanged over the web
			- syntax: {"key1":"value1", "key2":"value2"}
				- {} represent an object
				- key represent a field
				- value represent the field's value

JSON Marshalling/Object mapping
	- Converting Java Objects to JSON
		- mapping for data exchange
	- Jackson-databind
		- provides us with an object mapper to convert Java to JSON and vice versa
		- Jackson integrates very well with javalin
	

Wednesday

Handler groups
	- Grouping HTTP handlers/setting up path to handle different resources (ie: Pokemons)
		- app.routes()
			- can then set up paths (nested paths as well) for the different resources
				- path("resourceName", () -> {
						get(//Handling behavior);
						post(...);
						path("...")...
					});
	- handler methods in Controllers should take Context object as param to interact the Http request and response

URL - Uniform Resource Locator
	- Location for where a resource (on a server) is located
	- URL => protocol + domain name (host + port) + URI + parameters
 
	
	- URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=java+documentation&rlz=1C1GCEU_enUS924US924&oq=java+documen&aqs=chrome.0.0i433i512j69i57j0i512l5j69i60.4432j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
	
	- protocol - https://
	- domain name - www.google.com
	- URI - search
		- Uniform Resource Identifier
			- specifically determines a resource/service requested
	- parameters (query params)
		- ?param1=value1&param2=value2...
		- q=java+documentation
		- &rlz=1C1GCEU_enUS924US924
		- &oq=java+documen
		- &aqs=chrome.0.0i433i512j69i57j0i512l5j69i60.4432j0j7
		- &sourceid=chrome
		- &ie=UTF-8

Path param
	- parameter embedded in the url
		- resources/{path-param}/{something}
		- employees/{id}/reimbursements?param1=value1
	


base-app-endpoints

- /employees
	GET - return all employees
	POST - create a new employee
	 - /employees?manager-id=[value]
		GET - return all employees with a specific manager (based on id)
	 - /employees?username=[value]
		GET - return all employees with a specific username (in this case, just one)
	
- /employees/{id}
	GET - returning employee with id specified
	PUT - update employee with that id
			- FTAL(for this application's logic): this is just for basic information
				- username, password, name
		
- /employees/{id}/admin
	PUT - update employee with that id
			- FTAL(for this application's logic): this is just for admin information
				- Role, manager
				- needs to have a role of Admin to use this endpoint

- /auth
	POST - login 
		- send username/password
		- retrieve Authorization Header if login was successful

For ERS, endpoint/HTTP verb to create reimbursement?
	- /reimbursements - POST
		- JSON representation of reimbursement
			- field with employee-id
	- /createANewreimbursementforthisid/{id}
		- if this was the endpoint, not very intuitive

Authentication
	- user being who they say they are
		- ie: login in

Authorization
	- user has the permission to do something/use some functionality

Query params:
	- localhost:8080/employees?username=kev&password=kevpass
		- bad for sensitive information as it's displayed in the url

x-www-form-urlencoded params
	- localhost:8080/employees
		- params are hidden in the body of the request
		- better practice with sensitive information
